Diameter comparison(colon) Jupiter has a diameter of approximately 111(comma)840 kilometers(comma) making it larger than all other planets in our solar system. The Sun\(single quote or apostrophe)s diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers(comma) which clearly surpasses that of Jupiter when considering planetary diameters.
