It’s over 10 times more massive than all the other planets combined and it is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium with traces of methane(comma) ammonia and water. Although we do not know what its weather looks like on a daily basis(comma) based on data collected from Jupiter’s atmosphere by Hubble Space Telescope over time we can infer that there are areas where it is cold and others which experience high temperatures due to compression caused by wind pressure or heat generated from radiation emitted during lightning strikes.(newline)(newline)Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. It has many moons orbiting it(comma) such as Ganymede and Callisto. Jupiter’s atmosphere contains thick clouds of ammonia that are covered by an ice layer made up of water and methane. The surface temperature on Jupiter can reach over 100 °C (368 K)(comma) which is much hotter than Earth’s average surface temperature of 25 °C (78 F).(newline)(newline)Jupiter’s size has been a source of debate for centuries(comma) with scientists arguing about its diameter and mass. The first measurements were made by Galileo in the early 1600s using his telescope to observe Jupiter’s moons. He found that they appeared to be slightly larger than Venus at their closest approaches to Earth; since he also knew how far away those two planets were from each other(comma) this led him to conclude that there must be a large object between them—in fact(comma) Jupiter itself!(newline)(newline)Astronomers have been studying Jupiter for decades now using ground-based telescopes and space probes like Voyagers 1 & 2 (which flew past this gas giant in 1979)(comma) Cassini-Huygens (which studied Saturn)(comma) Galileo (which orbited the planet until 1999)(comma) and Juno (which has been circling our sun’s largest sibling since 2006). One reason why this is important is because it affects our understanding of how giant planets form(colon) if we know what Jupiter looks like now(comma) then we can better guess at how it might have looked when it formed billions of years ago.(newline)(newline)## What are the major features of Jupiter?(newline)(newline)- The Great Red Spot(colon) a large storm that has been raging for centuries on Jupiter’s southern hemisphere. It is approximately 3 times as wide as Earth and 10+ times larger than any other known atmospheric feature in our solar system(comma) but it’s still only about 2% of the size of what we see from here on out!(newline)- Galilean moons(colon) some of them are visible with binoculars or telescopes from Earth; they include Io(comma) Europa and Ganymede—all named after mythical figures from Greek mythology who represent different aspects of human life(colon) sex (Io)(comma) women (Europa) and work/military service (Ganymede). These three moons were discovered by Galileo during his famous telescopic observations in 1610–1613; they include Io(comma) Europa and Ganymede—all named after mythical figures from Greek mythology who represent different aspects of human life(colon) sex (Io)(comma) women (Europa) and work/military service (Ganymede).

These are some very hot spots on Jupiter where winds blow at speeds up to 600 miles per hour!(newline)- The poles(colon) As opposed to Earth’ You can also see both poles at once with binoculars or telescopes from ground level; they include callisto(comma) juno and Titan. These are very cold spots on Jupiter where winds blow at speeds upwards of 800 miles per hour!(newline)- The rings(colon) Jupiter has a set of rotating rings around its equatorial zones; these are some very cold spots for the most part but there is an outer(comma) thin ring that contains many smaller plumes. These rings were actually discovered by Galileo during his famous observations in 1610–1613; he had no name for them at first because it was not clear where they originated until much later when astronomers figured out what was happening below its surface(colon) ice volcanoes formed there over millions of years!(newline)- The Great Red Spot/Zodiacal point system(colon) This is one cool spot originally thought to be an atmospheric feature but now known not to exist anymore; it’s actually a unique plasma cloud that rotates around Jupiter every 10 hours or so. It doesn’t rotate like most other planets do(comma) though; instead It moves in a haphazard fashion with many smaller storms constantly circling its surface for days at a time!(newline)- The lightning(colon) it’1-64 new moons that astronomers now believe these rings are made of radioactive isotopes which contain the remains of an asteroidal component of the Earth(comma) NASA has identified hydrogen. The Earth is hidden by the sun’s light and as other smartphone users have discovered and it is thought to be a hotspot(comma) this indicates that carbon dating may not exist because even though they are still unable to identify liquid water on Jupiter with any significant degree of certainty(comma) but they wore away(colon) Although they were once used as a way for astronomers to track the date of the new moon as it rotates around its axis!(newline)(newline)- The terms ‘frequently #1 (left square bracket)PAX(right square bracket) (a) starring role in a development that has been called an orbiting of the highest quality(comma) so many people use this term today.
