The initial answer provided may have been a mistake since it took 30 minutes to dry one shirt(comma) but we must verify if it\(single quote or apostrophe)s possible to dry all 10 shirts simultaneously.(newline)2. Given that drying takes place outdoors in the sun(comma) it is reasonable to believe that drying time will increase proportionally with environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.(newline)3. Therefore(comma) even though the initial answer was 30 minutes per shirt(comma) this may not be achievable for all 10 shirts at once due to external conditions.(newline)4. Thus(comma) a revised answer should consider the possibility of simultaneous drying limited by external factors. In this case(comma) we can assume that it will take longer than 30 minutes per shirt but less time than 1 hour (60 minutes) as an upper limit on how long it may take to dry all 10 shirts in the sun simultaneously.(newline)5.
