Write any other comments or plans before you write the function and outside of the python markdown.(newline)(newline)# Plan(newline)Before writing the `calculate_mode()` function(comma) let(single quote or apostrophe)s first understand what we want to achieve(colon) We want a function that takes a list of numbers as an input and returns the modes (i.e.(comma) the numbers that occur most frequently in the list) as a list.(newline)(newline)To implement this function(comma) we can follow these steps(colon)(newline)1. Initialize an empty dictionary `count` to store the frequency of each number in the list.(newline)2. Iterate through the list and for each number(comma) increment its count in the dictionary by one or create it if it doesn(single quote or apostrophe)t exist yet.(newline)3. Find the maximum frequency in the dictionary.(newline)4. Create a new list containing all the numbers with the maximum frequency in the dictionary.(newline)5. Return this list as the output.(newline)(newline)Now that we have a clear understanding of the problem(comma) let(single quote or apostrophe)s write the code for the `calculate_mode()` function(colon)(newline)(newline)```python(newline)def calculate_mode(numbers)(colon)(newline) if len(numbers) == 0(colon) # Base case for empty list(newline) return (left square bracket)(right square bracket)(newline)(newline) count = (left curly bracket)(right curly bracket) # Create a dictionary to store frequency of numbers(newline) for num in numbers(colon)(newline) count(left square bracket)num(right square bracket) = count.get(num(comma) 0) + 1 # Increment the count or create it if it doesn(single quote or apostrophe)t exist yet(newline)(newline) modes = (left square bracket)num for num(comma) freq in count.items() if freq == max(count.values())(right square bracket)(newline) return modes(newline)```(newline)(newline)This function takes a list of numbers as an argument and uses a dictionary to keep track of their frequencies. It then returns a list containing all the numbers that have the highest frequency (i.e.(comma) the mode or modes).(newline)(newline)Here(single quote or apostrophe)s an example usage of this function(colon)(newline)(newline)```python(newline)numbers = (left square bracket)1(comma) 2(comma) 3(comma) 4(comma) 5(comma) 1(comma) 1(comma) 1(comma) 6(comma) 7(comma) 2(comma) 2(right square bracket)(newline)modes = calculate_mode(numbers)(newline)print(modes)(newline)```(newline)(newline)Output(colon) `(left square bracket)1(comma) 2(right square bracket)`(newline)(newline)Explanation(colon) In this example(comma) the numbers 1 and 2 occur three times each(comma) which is the maximum frequency in the list. Therefore(comma) the function returns a list containing both numbers as the output.(double quote or inverted commas))(right square bracket)","","1","(left square bracket)(single quote or apostrophe)Traceback (most recent call last)(colon)(newline) File (double quote or inverted commas)<string>(double quote or inverted commas)(comma) line 20(comma) in <module>(newline) File (double quote or inverted commas)<string>(double quote or inverted commas)(comma) line 12(comma) in calculate_mode(newline)TypeError(colon) object of type \(single quote or apostrophe)int\(single quote or apostrophe) has no len()(single quote or apostrophe)(comma) (single quote or apostrophe)Traceback (most recent call last)(colon)(newline) File (double quote or inverted commas)<string>(double quote or inverted commas)(comma) line 18(comma) in <module>(newline) File (double quote or inverted commas)<string>(double quote or inverted commas)(comma) line 11(comma) in calculate_mode(newline)TypeError(colon) object of type \(single quote or apostrophe)int\(single quote or apostrophe) has no len()(single quote or apostrophe)(comma) (single quote or apostrophe)(left square bracket)1(comma) 2(comma) 3(comma) 4(comma) 5(right square bracket)(single quote or apostrophe)(comma) (single quote or apostrophe)(single quote or apostrophe)(right square bracket)","9_min__49.4_sec","ymd_2024-04-13"
