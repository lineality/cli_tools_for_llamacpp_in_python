The task asks us to find out how long it takes to dry 10 shirts in the sun simultaneously if it takes 30 minutes to dry one shirt.(newline)2. We can use the ratio of drying time for multiple shirts to determine the answer.

This is not correct(comma) as we know it should take only 30 minutes.(newline)(newline) Option 2 - It takes 60 minutes to dry 12 shirts (12/3 = 4; 30 times each).

This is still incorrect.(newline)(newline) Option 3 - It takes 30 minutes to dry one shirt(comma) so it would take 900 minutes (30 * 30) to dry 10 shirts in the sun simultaneously.
