For example(comma) if you want to calculate the result of `multiply(3(comma) 5(comma) 7)`(comma) this would be more concise in Rust(colon)(newline)```rust(newline)use std(colon)(colon)f64;(newline)fn multiply(a1(colon) f64(comma) a2(colon) f64) -> f64 (left curly bracket)(newline) let mut result = a1 * a2;(newline) 5.0 / 10.0 as f64(newline)(right curly bracket)(newline)// Test your code here(newline)\xa0(newline)let result = multiply(3.0(comma) 5.0);(newline)assert_eq!(result(comma) 145.0)(newline)```<|im_end|>(newline)<|im_start|>user(newline)Explain the role of fp-traits in Rust and how it can be used to achieve type safety.<|im_end|>(newline)<|im_start|>assistant(newline)Arguably(comma) the most powerful feature of Rust\(single quote or apostrophe)s type system is that it automatically ensures datatypes match(comma) without requiring explicit efforts. This is known as type conversion and is a key feature that allows Rust to be statically typed(comma) which means Rust can ensure that values are not accidentally converted into illegal types or values that the user doesn\(single quote or apostrophe)t want.(newline)(newline)The role of fp-traits in Rust is to allow you to write code in terms that are self-optimizing and safe by default(comma) without using boilerplate. In other words(comma) they make it easier to write clearly written code(comma) without having to worry about type safety by default.(newline)(newline)Here\(single quote or apostrophe)s a simple example of how fp-traits can be used to ensure your types match(colon)(newline)```rust(newline)// Define an `Even` trait for all even numbers(newline)trait Even (left curly bracket)(newline) fn result_sum(&self) -> usize;(newline)(right curly bracket)(newline)(newline)\xa0(newline)// We define an Even function for odd numbers in terms of the sum and square of digits(newline)impl Even for i32 (left curly bracket)(newline) fn result_sum(&self) -> usize (left curly bracket)(newline) 2 * self.digits().fold(0(comma) |x(comma) y| x + y) // sum of digits(newline) - (self as fp(colon)(colon)BigInt).sqrt() as usize(newline) (right curly bracket)(newline)(right curly bracket)(newline)```(newline)In this example(comma) the `Even` trait is a type-specification that ensures all `i32`-typed values meet the same rules. The `result_sum()` method returns the sum of digits of the value and squares the digits in reverse order. This ensures that negative numbers (which are part of the `Even` traits) don\(single quote or apostrophe)t do anything wrong(comma) because the result of their square digits will (double quote or inverted commas)blow up(double quote or inverted commas).(newline)(newline)Using fp-traits can be an elegant way to write code that is self-optimizing and safe by default. However(comma) it requires more work to define the methods for the (double quote or inverted commas)odd(double quote or inverted commas) types (e.g.(comma) `2` is odd)(comma) because the result of a (double quote or inverted commas)two(double quote or inverted commas) digit number is not divisible by 3(comma) but by 15.(newline)```rust(newline)// Define an odd trait for all numbers in terms of the sum and square of digits(newline)trait Odd (left curly bracket)(newline) fn result_sum(&self) -> usize;(newline)(right curly bracket)(newline)(newline)\xa0(newline)// We define a single Odd function to handle odd numbers only(newline)impl Odd for i32 (left curly bracket)(newline) fn result_sum(&self) -> usize (left curly bracket)(newline) 15.pow(2) + *self as fp(colon)(colon)BigInt - self(newline) .sqrt() as usize // because sqrt(n) > n (otherwise the result wouldn\(single quote or apostrophe)t be an integer)(newline) (right curly bracket)(newline)(right curly bracket)(newline)```(newline)This method works fine for `i32` and returns the sum of digits in reverse order. However(comma) it also blows up when used for positive numbers (`15`). For positive numbers (`10`)(comma) the result of their square digits is a repetitive series (1(comma) 4(comma) 9(comma) 16(comma) 25 ...)(comma) which makes the method not practical to use.<|im_end|>(newline)<|im_start|>assistant(newline)using methods like the `Odd` trait for all numbers<|im_end|>(newline)<|im_start|>assistant(newline)You can define a single `Odd` trait that handles positive and negative numbers. Here\(single quote or apostrophe)s an implementation(colon)(newline)```rust(newline)trait Odd (left curly bracket)(newline) fn result_sum(&self) -> usize;(newline)(right curly bracket)(newline)(newline)#(left square bracket)derive(Copy(comma) Clone)(right square bracket)(newline)struct Negative39401825947633537 (left curly bracket)(right curly bracket);(newline)(newline)impl Odd for Negative39401825947633537 (left curly bracket)(newline) fn result_sum(&self) -> usize (left curly bracket)(newline) -15.pow(2) + self as fp(colon)(colon)BigInt - self.sqrt()(newline) (right curly bracket)(newline)(right curly bracket)(newline)```(newline)This implementation defines an `Odd` trait for the negative cases (-39401825947633537). It provides methods like `result_sum()` that take a single argument of type `f64`.<|im_end|>(newline)(single quote or apostrophe))(comma) (0(comma) (single quote or apostrophe)status_message(colon) OK!!(single quote or apostrophe)(comma) (double quote or inverted commas) Write a function called multiply() in the rust language(comma) such that given input(s) are (a(comma) b(comma) c)(comma) so(comma) def multiply(a(comma) b(comma) c)(colon) and the output is Multiply three numbers.
