Therefore(comma) it\(single quote or apostrophe)s the weight of the son that prevents the man from lifting him. Thus(comma) the solution should involve either the man or the son bearing some form of additional weight to enable the man to lift the son.(newline)Option (double quote or inverted commas)1. The man(double quote or inverted commas) doesn\(single quote or apostrophe)t seem right because despite his inability to lift the son due to the son\(single quote or apostrophe)s heavy weight(comma) it implies that the man has some sort of control over lifting himself(comma) which he currently does not.

(newline)(newline)So(comma) the best solution plan for this task would be(colon) (double quote or inverted commas)The man and the son take turns carrying a weighted object between them to practice lifting heavy burdens together.(double quote or inverted commas) This means that while the son initially puts his weight on the man\(single quote or apostrophe)s shoulders(comma) the man can lift him up under certain conditions (like having a weighed object on his back).
