Each parameter will be of type float 64. This choice was made because the problem statement asks us to multiply three float numbers(comma) but it does not impose any restrictions on what values these numbers might take or how precise they should be represented in memory.(newline)- The function takes the product and returns a floating point number as the result.(newline)- It is important to note that the initial proposed solution did not specify what type the output of `multiply()` should be. This solution assumes it should be float 64(comma) to match the input parameters. If different types are required by other parts of the code that call this function(comma) we can easily modify the return type to meet those requirements.(newline)- We have chosen to use a simple multiplication operation (`*`) in our return statement because all we need is a straightforward mathematical answer. This decision was made due to the simplicity and efficiency of the operation. It must also be noted that Rust provides many other options for performing complex computations(comma) if required.(newline)- I hope this explanation helps clarify the design decisions behind this solution.
