The Sun is a star and not a planet. It has its own light. So it can be the largest planet in our solar system! Draft_revisions_and_comments(colon) We must compare the mass of each planet with that of the sun to find out which option is true. The Sun is the largest among all the planets in terms of their mass. It has a radius of approximately 695000 km and its mass is around 1.989 x 10^(left curly bracket)30(right curly bracket) kg (solution_plan_outline(colon) 2. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system with a diameter of about 11 billion km and a mass of about 317 trillion tonnes! Draft_revisions_and_comments(colon) The average distance between Jupiter and Sun is about 5.8 times greater than Earth\(single quote or apostrophe)s from the sun(comma) but their masses are not in the same ratio. While comparing the Sun with other planets in our solar system(comma) we should consider it to be a star that emits its own light.
